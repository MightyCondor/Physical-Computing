/*
 * Vapor Drive by Conor Hamilton -2/10/2019
 * This progam fades LEDs in and out in a circular pattern akin to the spinning of a hard drive platter
 * It starts with blue on one side and cycles to red on the other
 * This program is accompanied by a vaporwave styled HDD case
 * 
 * Fading code sampled from arduino analog fade example
